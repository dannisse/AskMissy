# Spring22-AskMissy
AskMissy is a software application that allows users to search
for educational resources based on the user's personal preferences.

# Description
The purpose of this project is to improve
resource finding capabilities for students, teachers, 
and librarians. The machine learning algorithm will provide
personalized search results based on user feedback and 
ratings.

A feedback/rating system is initiated and prompts
the user to rate and provide feedback for the resources 
presented. The overall rating does not affect the user’s 
personal profile recommendations because personalized
searching is still intact. The user’s feedback/ratings can be
viewed on their user profiles.

AskMissy’s personalized profiles
allow users to also view resources they previously used and 
saved. 

The software application is not only for registered
students, teachers, and faculty, but can also be utilized by 
non-registered guests. These guests are given limited access to 
ensure the safety of the registered students. 

AskMissy will be placed and implemented through the school
system, which can be accessible through the student and
teachers’ identification numbers. Those who are registered
will utilize their respective school system to authenticate 
individual profiles and then be given special access to the 
AskMissy search tool.
